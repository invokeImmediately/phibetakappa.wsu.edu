<h1><p><b>WSU Phi Beta Kappa opens applications for 2016-17 scholarships covering full tuition plus mandatory fees</b></p></h1>
<p><b>PULLMAN, Wash.—</b>The Gamma Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Washington State University is accepting applications through March 28, 2016 from undergraduates for 2016-17 scholarships that will cover full tuition costs plus mandatory-fees, announced Robert Ferguson, chair of the organization’s scholarships committee.</p>
<p>“The Gamma Chapter is very pleased to once again offer scholarships that recognize and foster excellence in liberal learning at the undergraduate level,” said Ferguson, who works for WSU Libraries as a strategic assessment data officer.</p>
<p>In the past five years, since the 2010-11 academic year, the Gamma Chapter has awarded generous scholarships to 14 rising seniors from a variety of majors. Also, each spring the chapter invites new members to join the society; in spring 2015, 74 students became members of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>Scholarship applicants for 2016-17 must submit a completed application packet by 5 p.m. on the deadline day. Eligible students must have senior class standing for that year; be certified into a major in the College of Arts and Sciences, the Murrow College of Communication, the Dept. of Human Development, the Program in Neuroscience, or the School of Molecular Biosciences; and have a cumulative GPA of 3.6 or higher through fall semester 2015.</p>
<p>Complete instructions, guidelines, information about required recommendation letters, and downloadable pdf forms are online at <u><a href="PhiBetaKappa.wsu.edu">PhiBetaKappa.wsu.edu</a></u>.</p>
<p>Phi Beta Kappa is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious academic honors organization, recognized for fostering excellence in liberal arts and sciences.</p>
<p>Membership signals to employers and graduate and professional schools that members have outstanding credentials. Just 10 percent of U.S. colleges have a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, and elected members must be in the top 10 percent of their class.</p>
<p>Of the 160 colleges and universities in the Pacific Northwest, only 9 have Phi Beta Kappa chapters. The WSU Gamma Chapter was established in 1928, making it one of the first founded at a land-grant university.</p>
